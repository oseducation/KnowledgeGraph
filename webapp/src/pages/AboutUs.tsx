                    <b>Vitsi AI</b> aims to revolutionize the way people approach lifelong learning by providing a personalized roadmap for acquiring knowledge. We present information as an acyclic graph where each node represents bite-sized knowledge or concept, and edges represent prerequisites. By mastering all the prerequisite nodes users can move onto the next one. Any knowledge in the world can be represented like this.

                <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
                    Traditional education, being course-based, tends to be inefficient:
                    <List>
                        <ListItemText>
                            1. Course content can not align with every learner&apos;s needs
                        </ListItemText>
                        <ListItemText>
                            2. Enrolling into a full course might be too much commitment
                        </ListItemText>
                        <ListItemText>
                            3. Courses are something you start and finish, not something you do - it&apos;s not aligned with lifelong learning
                        </ListItemText>
                        <ListItemText>
                            4. It is hard to understand where each individual course fits in the big picture of knowledge
                        </ListItemText>
                    </List>
